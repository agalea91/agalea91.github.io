I recently graduated from the University of Guelph, where I was part of the nuclear theory group.  My <a href="https://www.physics.uoguelph.ca/Nucweb/theses/Galea_Alexander_201601_Msc.pdf" target="_blank">M.Sc. thesis</a> project involved quantum Monte Carlo simulations of cold atoms.

Now I'm living in Calgary and spend my days coding in Python; <a href="https://github.com/agalea91" target="_blank">my projects</a> can be found on GitHub.  Here is link to <a href="https://galeascience.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/alexgalearesume.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a>.

During my time as a graduate student I was taught how to produce dependable research. In particular, this meant understanding every component of the model used to generate results. In this blog I will try my best to maintain the same integrity.

I have a <a href="https://asummerphotoblog.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">photography blog</a> and I also like to play sports like hockey and soccer and enjoy snowboarding and rock climbing.
